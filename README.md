# Linear dynamics of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid

This is a Python package for analyzing the linear dynamics of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid system. It provides the following functionalities

- the code is object-oriented and additional functions could be incorporated easily
- variation of system poles with flow velocity (root locus) for a given set of parameters
- time reponse to velocity impulse input and also arbitrary displacement and velocity inputs using state space approach
- energy dynamics of the system
- recording animations
